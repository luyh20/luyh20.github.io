  title: "Hybrid Physical Metric For 6-DoF Grasp Pose Detection"
  venue: ICRA, 2022
  description: "We proposed the hybrid physical metric to generate confidence labels for 6-dof grasp poses,
  and designed a transformer-based point cloud learning network, FGC_graspnet, to predict 6-dof grasp poses."

  title: "Hybrid Physical Metric For 6-DoF Grasp Pose Detection"
  venue: ICRA, 2022
  description: "We proposed the hybrid physical metric to generate confidence labels for 6-dof grasp poses,
  and designed a transformer-based point cloud learning network, FGC_graspnet, to predict 6-dof grasp poses."

  title: "VL-Grasp: a 6-Dof Interactive Grasp Policy for Language-Oriented Objects in Cluttered Indoor Scenes"
  venue: IROS, 2023
  description: "The VL-Grasp is a interactive grasp policy combined with visual grounding and 6-dof grasp pose 
  detection tasks. The robot can adapt to various observation views and more diverse indoor scenes to grasp the 
  target according to a human's language command by applying the VL-Grasp. Meanwhile, we build a new visual 
  grounding dataset specially designed for the robot interaction grasp task, called RoboRefIt."
